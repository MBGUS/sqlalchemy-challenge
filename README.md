# Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration
To begin, use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All of the following analysis should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

- Use the provided starter notebook and hawaii.sqlite files to complete your climate analysis and data exploration.
- Use SQLAlchemy create_engine to connect to your sqlite database.
- Use SQLAlchemy automap_base() to reflect your tables into classes and save a reference to those classes called Station and Measurement.
- Link Python to the database by creating an SQLAlchemy session.

Important Don't forget to close out your session at the end of your notebook.

# Step 2 - Climate App
Now that you have completed your initial analysis, design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.

- Use Flask to create your routes.
